# Analysis of Early Divergence Issue

## Observations from Training Log

1. **High Initial Loss**: Total loss starts at ~3.6, which is very high
2. **No Improvement**: Loss doesn't decrease over 3 epochs
3. **Divergence at Epoch 4**: NaN appears when learning rate is still high (9e-6)
4. **Gradient Norm is 0**: This suggests gradients might be vanishing or the monitoring isn't working

## Root Causes

1. **Too Many Refinement Modules Active**: All 6 refinement modules are enabled simultaneously
2. **Complex Loss Landscape**: Multiple loss components may conflict
3. **Progressive Upsampling Issues**: May be unstable with small ROI size (64x64)
4. **Initialization Issues**: Complex architecture may need better initialization

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Gradual Refinement Activation
Start with fewer refinement modules and add them progressively

### 2. Further Reduce Learning Rate
- Current: 1e-5
- Recommended: 2e-6 or 5e-6

### 3. Disable Mixed Precision
Mixed precision can cause instability with complex architectures

### 4. Simplify Initial Configuration
Start with only 1-2 refinement modules

### 5. Add Loss Clamping
Clamp individual loss components to prevent explosion

### 6. Better Weight Initialization
Use more conservative initialization for all modules
