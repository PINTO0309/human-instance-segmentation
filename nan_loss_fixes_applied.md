# NaN Loss Fixes Applied

## 1. Configuration Updates (✅ Done)
- Updated all refined model configurations in `config_manager.py`:
  - Learning rate: 5e-5 → 1e-5
  - Warmup epochs: 5 → 10
  - Gradient clipping: 5.0 → 1.0
  - Weight decay: 0.001 → 0.0001
  - Min LR: 1e-6 → 1e-7

## 2. Refinement Module Stability (✅ Done)
Updated `hierarchical_segmentation_refinement.py`:
- Blending weight initialization: 0.1 → 0.01
- Active contour smoothness: 0.1 → 0.01
- Boundary weight in loss: 5.0 → 2.0
- Distance transform threshold: 0.5 → 0.3
- Added gradient clamping (max=10.0) in active contour loss
- Added numerical stability checks in edge normalization
- Added Xavier initialization with gain=0.1 for edge conv layers

## 3. Loss Weight Reductions (✅ Done)
In `RefinedHierarchicalLoss`:
- Active contour weight: 0.1 → 0.01
- Boundary aware weight: 0.1 → 0.01
- Contour loss weight: 0.1 → 0.01
- Distance loss weight: 0.1 → 0.01

## 4. Gradient Monitoring (✅ Done)
Added to `train_advanced.py`:
- `compute_gradient_norm()` function
- `check_for_nan_gradients()` function
- NaN loss detection with batch skipping
- NaN gradient detection with parameter name logging
- Gradient norm tracking in training metrics
- Proper variable initialization and logger setup

## Ready to Train

The refined models should now train stably. Run your experiment with:

```bash
uv run python run_experiments.py \
  --configs rgb_hierarchical_unet_v2_attention_r64m64_refined \
  --epochs 20 \
  --batch_size 2
```

## What to Monitor

During training, watch for:
1. **Loss values**: Should decrease gradually without NaN
2. **Gradient norm**: Should typically be < 50, ideally < 10
3. **Loss components**: All should have reasonable values
4. **Warning messages**: Any NaN detections will be logged

## If Issues Persist

If you still see NaN losses:
1. Check the first few batches - the issue may be in data loading
2. Try disabling mixed precision: set `mixed_precision=False` in config
3. Reduce learning rate further to 5e-6
4. Disable some refinement modules temporarily to isolate the issue

The training should now proceed without NaN losses!
