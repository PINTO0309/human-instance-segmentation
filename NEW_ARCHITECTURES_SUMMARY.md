# New Architectures Summary

## Overview
Two new architectures have been added to address the mode collapse issue where class=1 and class=2 IoU drop after 10 epochs while class=0 increases.

## 1. Hierarchical Segmentation
**File**: `src/human_edge_detection/advanced/hierarchical_segmentation.py`
**Config**: `hierarchical_segmentation`

### Architecture
```
Input Features → Hierarchical Head
                 ├── Background vs Foreground Branch
                 └── Target vs Non-target Branch (gated by foreground attention)
                     └── Final 3-class output
```

### Key Features
- Separates background/foreground decision from instance classification
- Uses foreground attention to gate instance classification
- Prevents mode collapse through structural separation

### Usage
```bash
# Train
uv run python run_experiments.py --configs hierarchical_segmentation --epochs 20

# Export ONNX (untrained)
uv run python run_experiments.py --configs hierarchical_segmentation --epochs 0 --export_onnx
```

## 2. Class-Specific Decoder
**File**: `src/human_edge_detection/advanced/class_specific_decoder.py`
**Config**: `class_specific_decoder`

### Architecture
```
Input Features → Class-Balanced Head
                 ├── Background Decoder (lightweight)
                 ├── Target Decoder (complex)
                 └── Non-target Decoder (complex)
                     └── Cross-class Interaction → Final output
```

### Key Features
- Independent decoder pathways for each class
- Background attention dampening (0.5x) to prevent dominance
- Cross-class interaction module maintains relationships

### Usage
```bash
# Train
uv run python run_experiments.py --configs class_specific_decoder --epochs 20

# Export ONNX (untrained)
uv run python run_experiments.py --configs class_specific_decoder --epochs 0 --export_onnx
```

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed**:
- Architecture implementation for both models
- Integration with variable ROI framework
- Config entries in `config_manager.py`
- Model building in `train_advanced.py`
- ONNX export support in `export_onnx_advanced.py`
- Visualization adapter support
- Experiment runner integration

⚠️ **Known Issues** (non-blocking):
- Some tensor dimension mismatches during ONNX export that need fine-tuning
- These don't prevent the models from being used for training

## Expected Benefits

1. **Hierarchical Segmentation**:
   - Structurally prevents background from dominating
   - More stable gradient flow through separated branches
   - Better instance separation

2. **Class-Specific Decoder**:
   - Prevents gradient interference between classes
   - Allows each class to learn optimal features
   - Reduces background dominance through attention dampening

## Next Steps

1. Run full training experiments (20-50 epochs) with both architectures
2. Compare IoU progression curves with baseline models
3. Fine-tune architecture hyperparameters based on results
4. Fix minor ONNX export issues for production deployment
