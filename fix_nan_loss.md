# Strategies to Fix NaN Loss in Refined Models

## Problem Analysis
The NaN loss occurs at epoch 2, step 57, which suggests:
1. Gradient explosion during backpropagation
2. Numerical instability in refinement modules
3. Learning rate may be too high for the complex refinement architecture

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Reduce Learning Rate for Refined Models
Current: 5e-5 → Recommended: 1e-5 or 2e-5

### 2. Increase Gradient Clipping
Current: 5.0 → Recommended: 1.0 for refined models

### 3. Add Gradient Normalization
- Add gradient norm monitoring
- Implement adaptive gradient clipping

### 4. Numerical Stability in Refinement Modules
- Add epsilon values in divisions
- Use torch.clamp for bounded outputs
- Initialize weights more conservatively

### 5. Loss Weight Adjustments
- Reduce refinement loss weights initially
- Use gradual warm-up for refinement losses

### 6. Mixed Precision Training
- Use torch.cuda.amp with loss scaling
- Helps prevent underflow/overflow

## Implementation Steps

1. Update config_manager.py with refined model specific training parameters
2. Add numerical stability checks in refinement modules
3. Implement gradient monitoring in training loop
4. Add loss component tracking for debugging
